The binary calls strcpy on argv[1], we can do a buffer orverflow with it

We also see that the binary uses a pointer to function that is 
called at the end of main, this pointer to function is malloced after the buffer for strcpy.

We can probably override this buffer to function with the adress of the function n
(found with info func, the adress is 0x08048454), who cats the pass for level7.

The easiest solution is to spam the adress, as we don't have to find exactly where it is located relative to the buffer:

./level6 `python -c "print '\x54\x84\x04\x08' * 25"`

We could also find the offset by comparing the pointers malloc returned, if we needed to be more precise
