This level is basically the same as level3, just the call to printf is on another function so the stack layout is different.

In this case we have to set the variable at adress 0x8049810 to the value 0x1025544 (16930116 in dec),

And the %n argument must be the 12th.

We will use se same trick as in level3 to write any number of characters, and the $ modifier that let's us specify for the
%n flag that it will be the 12th one, without having to specify the others.

python -c "print '\x10\x98\x04\x08%+.16930111d%12\$n'" | ./level4
The program calls "/bin/cat /home/user/level5/.pass" instead of /bin/sh so we directly have the flag, after the output of printf
