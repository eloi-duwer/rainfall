The assembly of level8 is quite long, but we can understand quite easily
what is happening when we reconstruct the C code that created it:

The program reads stdin, and reacts to a few instructions: auth, reset, service and login.

We want to use the "login" command, as it will start a shell.
For this we understand that auth[32] must not be zero, but we cannot write this mutch in auth
(line 24 in my file source.c, strcpy is called only if our input is less than 30 bytes)

Luckily after login we can use the command "service", wich will call strdup on our text.
If we launch this command after login the string duplicated will be likely placed just after the login,
so login[32] can be in the range of the service string: 

level8@RainFall:~$ ./level8 
(nil), (nil) 
auth nothing
0x804a008, (nil) 
service sd;fkjasd;lfkjsafl;kjasdfl
0x804a008, 0x804a018 
login
$ cat /home/user/level9/.pass

And we get the flag
