We cannot easily use gdb on this one, as the .pass file is directly opened and read,
if we do it on gdb we don't have the rights to it and the program exits

Luckily we can bypass the program, as the line
str[atoi(argv[1])] = '\0';
puts a \0 pretty much everywhere we want on str and we then compare str with argv[1] itself

If we run it with "" it will compare two empty strings (atoi returns 0 on error), and launch a shell:

./bonus3 ''
