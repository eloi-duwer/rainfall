The binary main function calls the function p,
who uses gets.
Wee see that the function checks some part of the memory after gets against the value 0xb0000000,
it is to check that the return pointer does not point to the stack

We also see that the function calls strdup on our input at the end, so our input will also be on the heap

So we can execute a shellcode, at the adress on the heap

I found a shellcode here https://0xrick.github.io/binary-exploitation/bof5/#ShellCode

This shellcode is 55 bytes long, and we know with the same trick from level1 that we need 80 bytes before overriding the return pointer,
So we need 25 bytes of padding

We also need to find what is the return of strdup, to get the adress on the heap that we need to set as a return pointer

gdb level2
break *0x0804853d (the adress just after strdup)
r
(input anything)
x/s $eax print the adress inside eax (the return of strdup), and the content at this adress as a string

So the adress of the pointer on the stack will be 0x804a008

We just need to construct our exploit string, this is done in the same manner as the level1, with a shellcode

scp -P 4242 ./exploit.py level2@<vm adress>:/tmp/exploitlvl2.py

On the vm
pyhon tmp/exploitlvl2.py > /tmp/overflowlvl2
cat /tmp/overflowlvl2 | ./level2

The shellcode reopens a tty on stdin, so we don't have to do it with cat
