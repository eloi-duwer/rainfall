We use gdb to see what appends in the binary

gdb level0
disass main

We see at adress 0x08048ed4 a call to atoi,
the return of atoi is compared to 0x1a7 (423 in dec),
if they are equal the binary sets the uid and gid, and then
calls execv with argument "/bin/sh", it effectively launches a shell
with level1 as the user

./level0 423
cat /home/user/level1/.pass
And we get the flag
